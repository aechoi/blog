Hi, I'm a PhD student at the University of Washington studying robotics and control. Previously I worked at Amazon as an Applied Scientist, and before that as a Mechanical Engineer. Even further back, I co-founded Longhorn Racing Electric, the Formula SAE Electric team at UT Austin.

In my free time I do recreational math, code, [play chess](https://www.chess.com/member/westisure), reschedule D&D sessions, and walk my dog (you can see Isaac's ears in the pic).
