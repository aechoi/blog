    "text": "My senior design project was essentially randomly assigned.\nThe professor gave us a list of potential projects and told us to group up and rank our top five. When we got our assignments, I was a bit disappointed and confused because I got a project that I did not list on my preferences (something to do with measuring strain using digital image correlation). Stranger still, there had been other people that wanted our project. The professor said that the decisions were final. When asked, he said he ran a monte carlo simulation and picked the one that looked the best. We’re not exactly sure what criteria he used, but the result was that many students were suboptimally assigned.\nYears later, I sometimes think of this, and having TA’d some courses with group projects, I wondered if there was a better way. The following is an approach that uses integer programming.\nSay you have \\(N\\) students and \\(M\\) projects. The goal is to group students to the projects they want in a way that optimizes for some sort of preference. For now, let’s say every student provides a dissatisfaction score \\(d_{n,m} \\in [0, \\infty)\\) for each project. Each student then has a vector \\(d_n \\in \\mathbb R^M\\), and the entire class can be described using the following matrix. \\[\nD = \\begin{bmatrix}\n| & & | \\\\\nd_{1} & \\cdots & d_{N} \\\\\n| & & |\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nEach student must be assigned to one project. This can be described using a 1-hot vector, \\(a_n\\in\\mathbb R^m\\), where the 1 corresponds to the assigned project. Again, the entire class can be assigned using a matrix. This will act as our decision variable. \\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n| & & | \\\\\na_{1} & \\cdots & a_{N} \\\\\n| & & |\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\] We can set maximum and minimum group sizes by specifying that the sum of the rows of \\(A\\) must be between the bounds.\nFor our objective, let’s go with minimizing the total dissatisfaction of the class. This can be notated concisely as \\(\\min_A\\ \\text{Tr}(D^\\intercal A)\\). We can run our optimization as follows.\n\nimport cvxpy as cp\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(0)\n\nnum_projects = 50\nnum_students = 200\n\nmin_group_size = 3\nmax_group_size = 5\n\ndissatisfaction_matrix = np.random.rand(num_projects, num_students)\nassignment_matrix = cp.Variable((num_projects, num_students), boolean=True)\n\nobjective = cp.Minimize(cp.trace(dissatisfaction_matrix.T @ assignment_matrix))\n\nconstraints = []\nconstraints += [cp.sum(assignment_matrix, axis=0) == 1]  # each student gets assigned to only 1 project\nconstraints += [cp.sum(assignment_matrix, axis=1) &gt;= min_group_size]\nconstraints += [cp.sum(assignment_matrix, axis=1) &lt;= max_group_size]\n\nproblem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)\nproblem.solve()\n\nstudent_dissatisfaction = np.diag(dissatisfaction_matrix.T @ assignment_matrix.value)\nprint(f\"The most dissatisfaction a student has is {np.max(student_dissatisfaction):.2f}/1.0\")\n\nThe most dissatisfaction a student has is 0.11/1.0\n\n\nThat’s pretty good, but this doesn’t yet solve our problem. It’s unreasonable for a student to provide an absolute score for each project. Asking them to pick and rank their top five is much more reasonable. There are many ways you could map a list of five selections to dissatisfaction. One way is to assign constant values to the selections (say, 0 dissatisfaction for your top choice, 0.1 for your second, etc). Then, pick some large value for all omitted projects.\n\nnum_ranks = 5\nomit_cost = 10\n\n# generate rankings from some underlying absolute total ranking\nabsolute_rankings = np.random.rand(num_projects, num_students)\nrankings = np.argsort(absolute_rankings, axis=0)\ntrunc_ranks = rankings[:num_ranks, :]\n\ndissatisfaction_matrix = np.zeros((num_projects, num_students)) + omit_cost\nstudent_vec = np.arange(num_students)\nfor idx, rank in enumerate(trunc_ranks):\n    dissatisfaction_matrix[rank, student_vec] = idx\ndissatisfaction_matrix /= omit_cost # normalize\n\nobjective = cp.Minimize(cp.trace(dissatisfaction_matrix.T @ assignment_matrix))\n\nproblem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)\nproblem.solve()\n\nstudent_dissatisfaction = np.diag(dissatisfaction_matrix.T @ assignment_matrix.value)\nprint(f\"The most dissatisfaction a student has is {np.max(student_dissatisfaction):.2f}/1.0\")\n\nThe most dissatisfaction a student has is 0.20/1.0\n\n\nThis still works. We know that no one was assigned a project they didn’t like because the most dissatisfaction is less than 1. However, maybe we just got lucky. We’re assigning uniformly random preferences for everyone, so it seems likely you’d be able to get everyone something that they like.\nLet’s assume that the popularity of certain projects follows a sort of Zipfian distribution.\n\ndef zipf_pmf(k, N):\n    \"\"\"Return the value of a Zipf probability mass function\"\"\"\n    return 1 / k * 1 / np.sum(1 / np.arange(1, num_projects + 1))\n\nproject_probabilities = zipf_pmf(np.arange(1, num_projects + 1), num_projects)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.bar(np.arange(num_projects), project_probabilities)\nax.set_ylabel(\"Probability\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Project Index\")\n_ = ax.set_title(\"Probability of Picking a Project\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll assume that students populate their preference list by picking from this distribution without replacement.\n\ntrunc_ranks = []\nfor _ in range(num_students):\n    trunc_ranks.append(np.random.choice(np.arange(num_projects), 5, replace=False, p=project_probabilities))\n\ntrunc_ranks = np.asarray(trunc_ranks).T\n\nNow we can solve as before.\n\ndissatisfaction_matrix = np.zeros((num_projects, num_students)) + omit_cost\nstudent_vec = np.arange(num_students)\nfor idx, rank in enumerate(trunc_ranks):\n    dissatisfaction_matrix[rank, student_vec] = idx\ndissatisfaction_matrix /= omit_cost # normalize\n\nobjective = cp.Minimize(cp.trace(dissatisfaction_matrix.T @ assignment_matrix))\n\nproblem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)\nproblem.solve()\n\nstudent_dissatisfaction = np.diag(dissatisfaction_matrix.T @ assignment_matrix.value)\nprint(f\"The most dissatisfaction a student has is {np.max(student_dissatisfaction):.2f}/1.0\")\n\nThe most dissatisfaction a student has is 0.40/1.0\n\n\nAs expected, the worst case dissatisfaction did go up. But, you know what I can’t get over?\n\nprint(f\"Number of students that didn't get anything on their list: {np.sum(student_dissatisfaction == 1)}.\")\n\nNumber of students that didn't get anything on their list: 0."

    "text": "I made a script to make regular audio sound 3D\nBack around 2012 I saw this demo on YouTube about a “Virtual Barber Shop”. When listened to with headphones, the actors are able to move around the listener as if they were in the room with you.\nIt’s actually still up (at the time of writing). Worth a listen if you’ve never heard it before.\n\nHearing this for the first time was what I imagine it was like for people to see color movies and TV for the first time.\nMore recently (during Covid boredom) I wanted to look more deeply into how this sort of audio could be made and to see if there was a way to do it without buying expensive hardware.\nOften the explanation people give is that this is an example of “binaural audio” where microphones are placed inside a dummy head (like the one pictured below) so that the differences heard between the left and right ear are interpreted as directions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis certainly plays a part but is not the whole story. The problem with that explanation is that it doesn’t explain why you can tell when a sound comes from above or below you. In those cases, the sounds entering your left and right ear could be the exact same yet you can still localize the sound in the correct direction. The same goes for when a sound is directly in front or behind you. Simply adding delay to one side or the other is not sufficient to encode all of the spatial data.\nThe frequency content of the sounds themselves are subject to different transfer functions that are a function of the relative position of the sound origin to your head, the shape and composition of your head, the shape of your ears, the room your in, and a variety of other factors.\nThese Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) can be modeled and measured. In fact there is a convenient online database filled with many examples. Generally these transfer functions are stored as an array of pairs of impulse responses (one for each ear). Convolving these impulse responses with any audio file lets you make the audio sound like it’s coming from somewhere in space.\nThese impulse responses are generally collected over the surface of multiple spheres at many distances from the listener.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an example implementation I made using Bernschütz (2013). The code can be found on my github page here.\n\nIn it, I use a method found in Gamper (2013) to search for and interpolate the HRIRs. The method involves triangulating (tetrating?) the space using Delaunay triangulation. Then, given some starting tetrahedron, determine which vertex is furthest from the desired point in space. The tetrahedron that shares the face opposite that vertex is then the next nearest of the neighboring tetrahedrons. This process is continued until the desired point lies within the current tetrahedron.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce found, the HRIRs at the vertices of that tetrahedron can be interpolated together using barycentric interpolation, providing a smooth transition when the point moves across the space to other tetrahedrons. The audio can now be convolved with the appropriate HRIR.\nWhen I first worked on this project back in 2020, I just had a little GUI that the user could interact with (as seen in the video above). Later on, I wanted to make a more hands-free way to move the audio around that could be used when on a call, streaming, or recording video.\nI implemented some head tracking and mapped the location of the face in the frame to control the source location using OpenCV and MediaPipe. Below is a quick demo. The code can be found on my repo.\n\nUltimately I was hoping that I could prank some of my coworkers in our online meetings, but it turns out most VOIP software streams mono audio to save on network bandwidth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit History\n\n\n\n\n2025-07-31: Reformatted for new site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBernschütz, Benjamin. 2013. “A Spherical Far Field HRIR/HRTF Compilation of the Neumann KU 100.” In Proceedings of the AIA-DAGA Conference on Acoustics.
