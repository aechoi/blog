    "For many, phasors can feel a bit mystical. Many students may simply memorize the rules associated with them and run calculations without developing a more fundamental understanding. It's not uncommon for this to be the case at both the undergraduate and graduate level. \n",

    "Exponential notation, $e^a$, naivly seems to imply $a$ repeated multiplications of $e$. However, recall that exponents have been extended from natural numbers to whole numbers ($e^0 = 1$), integers ($e^{-a} = 1/e^a$), rational numbers ($e^{1/2} = \\sqrt{e}$), and real numbers ([$e^\\pi - \\pi = 20$](https://xkcd.com/217/)). None of these hold on to the concept of repeated multiplication. Instead, they use a different property of exponentiation to derive these relationships (namely, $e^ae^b=e^{a+b} \\implies \\exp(a)\\exp(b) = \\exp(a+b)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties of exponentials can be generalized further to accept complex inputs.
