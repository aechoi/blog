    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For many, phasors can feel a bit mystical. Many students may simply\n",
    "memorize the rules associated with them and run calculations without\n",
    "developing a more fundamental understanding. It’s not uncommon for this\n",
    "to be the case at both the undergraduate and graduate level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this document is to motivate the use of phasors from the\n",
    "ground up, as well as to provide visual representations of complex\n",
    "numbers that make them intuitive to understand. Hopefully by the end,\n",
    "they seem like an obviously good choice for modeling sinusoidal signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Preliminaries: Complex Numbers and Euler’s Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before talking about sinusoids or time domain signals, let’s start by\n",
    "coming to grips with Euler’s equation. Let’s start by asking the\n",
    "question, what does it mean to raise a number to an imaginary power?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e^i = ?$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponential notation, $e^a$, naivly seems to imply $a$ repeated\n",
    "multiplications of $e$. However, recall that exponents have been\n",
    "extended from natural numbers to whole numbers ($e^0 = 1$), integers\n",
    "($e^{-a} = 1/e^a$), rational numbers ($e^{1/2} = \\sqrt{e}$), and real\n",
    "numbers ([$e^\\pi - \\pi = 20$](https://xkcd.com/217/)). None of these\n",
    "hold on to the concept of repeated multiplication. Instead, they use a\n",
    "different property of exponentiation to derive these relationships\n",
    "(namely, $e^ae^b=e^{a+b} \\implies \\exp(a)\\exp(b) = \\exp(a+b)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties of exponentials can be generalized further to accept\n",
    "complex inputs. Just like how exponentiation can be generalized from\n",
    "repeated multiplication to a function that relates the product of\n",
    "outputs to the sum of inputs, it can be generalized again such that it\n",
    "is a function that is its own derivative.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "e^x = \\frac{\\text{d}e^x}{\\text{d}x}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "We will first derive Euler’s Equation, then examine some of its\n",
    "properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Deriving Euler’s Equation from Picard Iterates\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we want to define a function, $f(x)$, that is equal to its own\n",
    "derivative. $$f(x) = f'(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You may already know what the answer is, but let’s try to rederive it.\n",
    "We’ll start by making a guess. $$f_0(x) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a pretty bad guess. We know that $f_0'(x) = 0$, but we need\n",
    "$f_0'(x) = f_0(x) = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watch how we’ll improve this iteratively (for a truly rigorous\n",
    "treatment, see [Picard\n",
    "Iterates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard–Lindelöf_theorem)).\n",
    "\n",
    "We end up with a familiar equation for the Taylor expansion of $e^x$.\n",
    "Notationally, we can keep the form of $e^x$, but semantically we should\n",
    "refer to this infinite sum.\n",

    "where $\\theta \\in \\mathbb R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{i\\theta} = 1 + i\\theta + \\frac{-\\theta^2}{2} + i\\frac{-\\theta^3}{3!} + \\dots \\\\\n",
